[Fourmilab Pumpkin Head](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Pumpkin-Head-and-Decoration/22695803)
is a jack-o'lantern (pumpkin carved with a face, lit from within) which 
may be worn as a head with both mesh and classic avatars, or used as a 
static decoration for Halloween and other occasions.   It includes a 
script that allows you to configure its behaviour via chat commands, 
and provides features such as brightening the glow of the light when 
you're typing in chat.
